Mara Moja is a shopping list app that allows users to sign up for an account and then create a shopping list with item names, prices, and descriptions. After purchasing an item, the user may be able to check it off their list.

## Technologies Used

* CSS
* ReactJS
* Ruby
* Sinatra API Server

## Setup / Installation Requirements

* Web Browser
* Internet connection

## MVPs

A landing page with:

* Login and SignUp Form

* Form To Add Shopping Items

* Shopping List Display Section

### Installation steps

* The API is built on localhost.

* To run locally, fork and clone the repository to your local machine, then run `npm install` to add dependencies.

* Fork and clone the backend API (https://github.com/JamesKibathi/grp4-backend-new) and follow the installation steps as outlined on the README of the repo.

* Run and start the server.

### How it works

If you don't have an account already, you will be allowed to create one
by clicking on the link: `Don't have an account? Create Account`

Upon a successful Login, You will be redirected to your account where you will be
able to generate a shopping list.
